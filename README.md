# AWS Full-Stack Application

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a responsive full-stack application built with React, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and EC2. The application allows users to input text and upload a file. These inputs are then processed on an EC2 instance that appends the input text to the uploaded file, and the result is stored back in S3.

## Architecture
This solution implements a serverless architecture with the following AWS services:
- **Amazon S3**: Used for storing uploaded files securely.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database to store metadata about file uploads and processing.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing service to handle business logic, including file metadata storage and retrieval.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Managed service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing APIs.
- **Amazon EC2**: Virtual server used for processing data in a scalable manner.
- **AWS Cognito**: Provides user identity and data synchronization to enable secure access control.
- **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)**: Used to define cloud infra resources programmatically in TypeScript.

The frontend is built using React with TailwindCSS for styling and Flowbite for component integration. AWS Amplify hosts the frontend, providing a CI/CD pipeline directly from a GitHub repository.

## Directory Structure

## Prerequisites
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Node.js and npm
- AWS Account and user with administrator access
- AWS CDK installed globally

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
Ensure that the AWS CLI is configured with the correct credentials and default region:
```bash
aws configure
```

### 2. Deploy Backend Infrastructure
Navigate to the root of the project and install dependencies:
```bash
cd my-fullstack-project
npm install
```
Deploy the infrastructure using CDK:
```bash
cdk deploy
```

### 3. Run Frontend Locally
Install dependencies and start the React application:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
This will serve the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Build and Deploy Frontend
To build and deploy the frontend application using AWS Amplify, follow these commands:
```bash
amplify add hosting
amplify publish
```

## Usage
The application provides a user interface where users can:
- Enter text into an input field.
- Upload a file.
- Submit the form, which triggers the backend processes.

The process includes:
- Directly uploading the file to S3 using a pre-signed URL.
- Storing file metadata in DynamoDB.
- Triggering an EC2 instance to process the file.
- Updating DynamoDB with the processing results.

## Security Considerations
- The S3 bucket is configured to deny public access.
- DynamoDB tables store metadata securely and are only accessible via authenticated AWS Lambda functions.
- API Gateway is secured with AWS Cognito, ensuring that only authenticated users can access APIs.
- IAM roles and policies are tightly scoped to follow the principle of least privilege.

## Maintenance and Monitoring
- AWS CloudWatch is used to monitor the application and log all activities.
- Regular audits of IAM roles and policies are recommended.
- Updates to AWS Lambda and EC2 AMIs should be monitored and applied as needed.
